# Rationale: gov_action1pvv5wmjqhwa4u85vu9f4ydmzu2mgt8n7et967ph2urhx53r70xusqnmm525
Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.0` (raw `-0.07` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.04`) | Confidence: `0.7` | Readiness: `0.85`
> Reasoning layer (deterministic-heuristic): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a hardfork action: 8 well-supported claim(s), hardfork doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment +0.040 (clamped to ±0.05).

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records ABSTAIN on Hard Fork to Protocol Version 10 ("Plomin" Hard Fork). This is a conservative abstention because the evidence does not justify stronger certainty.

The action is a HardForkInitiation. The cached anchor describes the request as: Hard Fork to Protocol Version 10 ("Plomin" Hard Fork). The strongest grounded claim is: We propose to upgrade Cardano mainnet to Protocol Version 10.

Reason code: DREP_DISTRIBUTION_MISSING.

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `ready`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: HardForkInitiation
- finding: Status: enacted
- finding: Proposed epoch: 529
- finding: Expires after epoch: 536
- finding: Treasury request: not specified
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `complete`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: yes
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: not required
- finding: Requested: Hard Fork to Protocol Version 10 ("Plomin" Hard Fork)
- finding: Recipient: 
- finding: Stated amount: not stated in document
- finding: Deliverables: We propose to upgrade Cardano mainnet to Protocol Version 10., This upgrade will be achieved via a Hard Fork (called "Plomin")., The Cardano mainnet protocol will be upgraded to Major Version 10 and Minor Version 0; 2., All 7 governance actions that are described in CIP-1694 will be enabled; 3.
- finding: Deadline/expiry: not stated in document
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, low materiality): We propose to upgrade Cardano mainnet to Protocol Version 10.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): This upgrade will be achieved via a Hard Fork (called "Plomin").
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, low materiality): The Cardano mainnet protocol will be upgraded to Major Version 10 and Minor Version 0; 2.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): All 7 governance actions that are described in CIP-1694 will be enabled; 3.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): Protocol Version 10 enables the remainder of the CIP-1694 functionality, ensuring that DReps can participate in voting on all governance actions.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): It enables treasury withdrawals, the ability to record a new constitution, updates to the constitutional committee, and votes of no confidence.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: high
- finding: Governance risk: high
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: confirmed
- finding: Flag count: 0
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "We propose to upgrade Cardano mainnet to Protocol Version 10." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: weak controls, unclear delivery, or governance precedent could outweigh the benefit of HardForkInitiation.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Pinned anchor document is available for this action.
- Hard fork actions are high-impact protocol upgrades and require operator-aware review.
- Intake: Action type: HardForkInitiation
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Risk review: Execution risk: high
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "We propose to upgrade Cardano mainnet to Protocol Version 10." and clears the evidence gates.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- Advisory model lean was +0.040 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: Doctrine-aware offline lean for a hardfork action: 8 well-supported claim(s), hardfork doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment +0.040 (clamped to ±0.05).
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- No DRep distribution available.
- Protocol action lacks a complete independently pinned readiness packet: version_guardrails_pass, testnet_results_pass, spo_readiness_pass, exchange_readiness_pass, dapp_readiness_pass, security_review_pass, constitutional_alignment_pass, rollback_or_containment_plan
