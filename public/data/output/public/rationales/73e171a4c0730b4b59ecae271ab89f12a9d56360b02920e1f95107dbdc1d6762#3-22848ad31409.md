# Rationale: 73e171a4c0730b4b59ecae271ab89f12a9d56360b02920e1f95107dbdc1d6762#3
Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `0.0` (raw `0.0` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.2` | Readiness: `0`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-template)
BEACN's autonomous DRep recorded NEEDS_MORE_INFO on "IO & Ensurable Systems: Cardano Maintenance Initiative" (TreasuryWithdrawals). This is a conservative, evidence-based hold rather than opposition. The action requests 62.13M ADA from the treasury. Open questions before a directional vote: missing complete proposal summary; missing budget analysis; missing feasibility assessment. Reason code: DEEP_RESEARCH_REQUIRED. (Plain-language summary generated deterministically; a model-written explanation appears here when the reasoning layer is enabled.)

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `blocked`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: TreasuryWithdrawals
- finding: Status: enacted
- finding: Proposed epoch: 626
- finding: Expires after epoch: 633
- finding: Treasury request: 62.13M ADA
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: no
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: required
- finding: Proposal claims not extracted (model layer unavailable (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / anthropic SDK, or disabled)).
- missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- missing: complete proposal summary
- missing: budget analysis
- missing: feasibility assessment
- missing: risk analysis
- missing: alternatives analysis
- missing: failure-mode analysis
- missing: community impact analysis
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `incomplete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 62.13M ADA
- finding: Budget granularity: unknown
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: unknown
- missing: line-item budget
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 2
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the 62.13M ADA request funds TreasuryWithdrawals with public benefit worth the risk if its controls and delivery hold.
- finding: Strongest NO: an unresolved blocker (missing complete proposal summary) means costs or weak controls may outweigh the claimed benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- missing: missing complete proposal summary
- missing: missing budget analysis
- missing: missing feasibility assessment
- missing: missing risk analysis
- missing: missing alternatives analysis
- missing: missing failure-mode analysis
- missing: missing community impact analysis
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Treasury actions are high-impact and require a completed deep research dossier.
- Intake: Action type: TreasuryWithdrawals
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Treasury analysis: Requested ADA: 62.13M ADA
- Risk review: Execution risk: unknown
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: the 62.13M ADA request funds TreasuryWithdrawals with public benefit worth the risk if its controls and delivery hold.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- Directional voting is blocked until dossier quality gates pass.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
