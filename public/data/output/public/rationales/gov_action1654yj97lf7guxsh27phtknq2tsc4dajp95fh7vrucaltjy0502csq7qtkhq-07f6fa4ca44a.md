Score: `0.0` | Confidence: `0.2` | Readiness: `0`

## Plain-language explanation (codex-offline-review)
BEACN records NEEDS_MORE_INFO on Reimburse Ikigai Info Governance Action Deposit.. This is an evidence hold, not opposition: BEACN cannot make a directional treasury judgment from the current record.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Reimburse Ikigai Info Governance Action Deposit.. The recorded treasury amount is 103.0k ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: In September 2024, only weeks after the Chang hard fork to introduce on-chain governance, an Info governance action titled Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai - was submitted.

A material weak point is that this claim remains proposer-asserted or thinly supported: There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed. The blocking questions are: missing budget analysis; missing feasibility assessment; missing alternatives analysis. Reason code: DEEP_RESEARCH_REQUIRED.

- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: not confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: not confirmed
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: confirmed
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: not confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: unsustainable
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.70

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: low
- finding: Governance risk: low
- finding: Technical risk: low
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: low
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed

- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "In September 2024, only weeks after the Chang hard fork to introduce on-chain governance, an Info governance action titled Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai - was submitted." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- missing: missing budget analysis
- missing: missing feasibility assessment
- missing: missing alternatives analysis
- missing: missing failure-mode analysis
- missing: missing community impact analysis
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
