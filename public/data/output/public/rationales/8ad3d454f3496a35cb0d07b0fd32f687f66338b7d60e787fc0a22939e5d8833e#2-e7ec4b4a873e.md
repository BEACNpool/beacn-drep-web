# Rationale: 8ad3d454f3496a35cb0d07b0fd32f687f66338b7d60e787fc0a22939e5d8833e#2
Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.0` (raw `0.0` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.1` | Readiness: `0`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records ABSTAIN on Withdraw ₳1,300,000 for Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal. This is a conservative abstention because the evidence does not justify stronger certainty.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Withdraw ₳1,300,000 for Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal. The strongest grounded claim is: This treasury withdrawal funds Blockfrost Platform community budget proposal which will provide the following services Blockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your ow.

Open blockers: treasury_amount_lovelace is missing for a treasury withdrawal. BEACN's own independent diligence is also incomplete — before this vote could move to YES, BEACN's published review still needs complete proposal summary; budget analysis; feasibility assessment. Reason code: MISSING_BASELINE_EVIDENCE.

- finding: Strongest NO: an unresolved blocker (treasury_amount_lovelace is missing for a treasury withdrawal) means costs or weak controls may outweigh the claimed benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
