Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `0.0` (raw `0.0` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.2` | Readiness: `0`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records NEEDS_MORE_INFO on Withdraw ₳314,800 for PyCardano administered by Intersect. This is an evidence hold, not opposition: BEACN cannot make a directional treasury judgment from the current record.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Withdraw ₳314,800 for PyCardano administered by Intersect. It asks the treasury for 314.8k ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: This treasury withdrawal funds PyCardano which will provide the following services: ​ PyCardano is a lightweight Python library that enables developers to interact seamlessly with the Cardano blockchain.

BEACN's own independent diligence is also incomplete — before this vote could move to YES, BEACN's published review still needs complete proposal summary; budget analysis; feasibility assessment. Reason code: DEEP_RESEARCH_REQUIRED.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `incomplete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 314.8k ADA
- finding: Budget granularity: unknown
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: unknown
- missing: line-item budget
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "This treasury withdrawal funds PyCardano which will provide the following services: ​ PyCardano is a lightweight Python library that enables developers to interact seamlessly with the Cardano blockchain." though 7 review blocker(s) remain open.
- finding: Strongest NO: an unresolved blocker (missing complete proposal summary) means costs or weak controls may outweigh the claimed benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- missing: missing complete proposal summary
- missing: missing budget analysis
- missing: missing feasibility assessment
- missing: missing risk analysis
- missing: missing alternatives analysis
- missing: missing failure-mode analysis
- missing: missing community impact analysis
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
