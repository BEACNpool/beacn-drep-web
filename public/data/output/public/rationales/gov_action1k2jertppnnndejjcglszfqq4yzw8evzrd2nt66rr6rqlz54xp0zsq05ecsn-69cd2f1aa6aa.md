Recommendation: **YES**
Score: `0.04` (raw `0.0` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.04`) | Confidence: `0.59` | Readiness: `0.85`
> Reasoning layer (codex-offline-review): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a parameter action: 7 well-supported claim(s), parameter doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment +0.040 (clamped to ±0.05).

## Plain-language explanation (codex-offline-review)
BEACN records YES on Plutus V3 Cost Model Parameter Changes Prior to Chang#2. The deterministic gates found enough evidence and no decisive blocker.

The action is a ParameterChange. The cached anchor describes the request as: Plutus V3 Cost Model Parameter Changes Prior to Chang 2. The strongest grounded claim is: We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang 2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10).

Residual uncertainty remains limited to the replayed evidence and the public resources cited by the run manifest.

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `ready`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: ParameterChange
- finding: Status: enacted
- finding: Proposed epoch: 519
- finding: Expires after epoch: 526
- finding: Treasury request: not specified
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `complete`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: yes
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: manifest
- finding: Deep research dossier: not required
- finding: Requested: Plutus V3 Cost Model Parameter Changes Prior to Chang 2
- finding: Recipient: 
- finding: Stated amount: not stated in document
- finding: Deliverables: We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang 2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10)., Existing Plutus cost model settings will not be changed., Note that the primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork)., Following the hard fork to Protocol Version 10, 12 new Plutus primitives will be available for bitwise and cryptographic operations.
- finding: Deadline/expiry: not stated in document
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang 2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10).
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, low materiality): Existing Plutus cost model settings will not be changed.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): Note that the primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork).
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): Following the hard fork to Protocol Version 10, 12 new Plutus primitives will be available for bitwise and cryptographic operations.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): This governance action provides cost model settings so that these primitives can be used following the Chang 2 hard fork.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): Note that the new primitives will not be enabled in Protocol version 9 (as enabled by the Chang hard fork).
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: confirmed
- finding: Flag count: 0
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang 2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10)." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: weak controls, unclear delivery, or governance precedent could outweigh the benefit of ParameterChange.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Pinned anchor document is available for this action.
- Protocol parameter changes carry system-wide risk.
- Intake: Action type: ParameterChange
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Risk review: Execution risk: unknown
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "We propose to update the Plutus V3 Cost Model via a Parameter Update governance action to enable the new Plutus primitives that will be available following the Chang 2 hard fork (to Protocol Version 10)." and clears the evidence gates.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- Doctrine-aware reasoning layer nudged the score by +0.040 (clamped to ±0.05): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a parameter action: 7 well-supported claim(s), parameter doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment +0.040 (clamped to ±0.05).
- Directional vote forced by completed readiness packet (treasury-aware).
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
