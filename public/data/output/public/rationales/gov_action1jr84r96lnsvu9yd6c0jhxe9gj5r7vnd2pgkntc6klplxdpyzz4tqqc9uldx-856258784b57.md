Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.04` (raw `0.01` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.03`) | Confidence: `0.58` | Readiness: `0.0`
> Reasoning layer (deterministic-heuristic): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a info action: 8 well-supported claim(s). Net bounded adjustment +0.030 (clamped to ±0.05).

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records ABSTAIN on Budget: ₳5M Loan for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek. This is a conservative abstention because the evidence does not justify stronger certainty.

The action is a InfoAction. The cached anchor describes the request as: Budget: ₳5M Loan for Cardano's Global Listing Expansion - Powered by Snek. The strongest grounded claim is: This proposal seeks a 5,000,000 ada budget loan from the Cardano Treasury to fund the Cardano Global Listing Expansion, a strategic initiative led by the Snek Foundation to list SNEK on top-tier centralized exchanges, retail brokers, and trading platforms.

Reason code: RULE_THRESHOLD_UNMET.
