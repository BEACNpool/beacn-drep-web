## Plain-language explanation (precomputed)
BEACN's autonomous DRep is recording ABSTAIN on this action, and the reason is procedural rather than a verdict on the proposal's merits. BEACN's on-chain governance data snapshot is currently about eight hours old, which is beyond the six-hour freshness limit its policy requires before it will cast a directional vote. When data is this stale BEACN holds rather than risk voting on an out-of-date picture of the proposal, the treasury, and the wider vote distribution. The request is narrow and sympathetic: 103,000 ADA to reimburse an early governance participant whose 100,000 ADA Info-action deposit was stranded by a documented Cardano node bug shortly after the Chang hard fork, plus 3,000 ADA for lost staking rewards. The core fact — that a node defect prevented recovery of the deposit — is independently checkable on-chain and is the strongest part of the case; the 2%-per-annum staking top-up is a reasonable but proposer-set figure. The amount is small relative to other live treasury actions and there is no ongoing delivery risk. Once BEACN's snapshot is current and the deep-research record confirms the bug and the recipient address, this is the kind of low-risk, well-bounded reimbursement on which it could reach a directional vote.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: yes
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: manifest
- finding: Deep research dossier: required
- finding: Requested: Treasury withdrawal to reimburse the unrecovered deposit from the Ikigai Info governance action and compensate claimed lost staking rewards.
- finding: Recipient: Ikigai Info governance action submitter; specific recipient address not stated in document
- finding: Stated amount: 103000
- finding: Deliverables: Instant on-chain distribution of the withdrawal amount to the intended recipient as part of governance action enactment
- finding: Deadline/expiry: not stated in document
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): The proposal says an Info governance action titled "Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai -" was submitted in September 2024 shortly after the Chang hard fork.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, low materiality): The proposal says the Ikigai action was symbolic and asked the community to agree with a statement thanking contributors and expressing hope for Cardano's future.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposal says a Cardano node bug allowed an unregistered stake key to be used in the governance action, preventing the submitter from recovering a 100000 ADA deposit.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): The proposal says community sentiment at the time favored reimbursing the deposit because the submitter should not lose 100000 ADA for being an early governance pioneer.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): The proposal says no entity-based budget submissions included this reimbursement after treasury withdrawals became available following the Plomin hard fork.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): The proposal says the Cardano in Oceania initiative included the reimbursement in its budget Info governance action, but that action was not approved.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal says an Info governance action titled "Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai -" was submitted in September 2024 shortly after the Chang hard fork.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal says community sentiment at the time favored reimbursing the deposit because the submitter should not lose 100000 ADA for being an early governance pioneer.

- missing: budget analysis
- missing: feasibility assessment
- missing: alternatives analysis
- missing: failure-mode analysis
- missing: community impact analysis
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `incomplete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 103000
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: not confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: not confirmed
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: confirmed
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: not confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: unsustainable
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.70
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: low
- finding: Governance risk: low
- finding: Technical risk: low
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: low
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: confirmed
- finding: Flag count: 2
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal says a Cardano node bug allowed an unregistered stake key to be used in the governance action, preventing the submitter from recovering a 100000 ADA deposit." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "The proposal says an Info governance action titled "Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai -" was submitted in September 2024 shortly after the Chang hard fork." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `blocked`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- missing: missing budget analysis
- missing: missing feasibility assessment
- missing: missing alternatives analysis
- missing: missing failure-mode analysis
- missing: missing community impact analysis
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
