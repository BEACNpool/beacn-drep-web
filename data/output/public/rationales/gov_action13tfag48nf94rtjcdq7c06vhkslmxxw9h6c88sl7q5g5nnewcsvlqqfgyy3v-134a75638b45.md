## Plain-language explanation (codex-offline-review)
BEACN records NO on Withdraw ₳2,162,096 for Midgard - Optimistic Rollups administered by Intersect. The decisive concern is that the proposal's risks, precedent, or evidence gaps outweigh the case presented.

The recorded treasury amount is 2.16M ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: This treasury withdrawal funds Midgard - Optimistic Rollups which will provide the following services: Midgard, which is a modular framework for deploying optimistic rollup Layer 2s on the Cardano blockchain, designed to enhance transaction throughput, redu...

Residual uncertainty remains limited to the replayed evidence and the public resources cited by the run manifest.
