# Rationale: dfd81f8db652fd9263e0ce3bef043b4823045ec3a5da10c817681ada7a23f034#0
Recommendation: **NO**
Score: `-0.1475` (binding treasury composite; advisory raw signal `-0.56`; LLM lean `-0.02` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.7569` | Readiness: `0.75`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The claims describe potentially high public-benefit infrastructure, but the deterministic assessment says evidence is thin and overall status is incomplete; for a large treasury request involving bridge custody and real BTC risk, the doctrine prioritizes treasury stewardship, protocol safety, and independently verified evidence over plausible ecosystem growth.

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records NO on Bifrost: Unlocking Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano — Road to Mainnet (Phase 1 of 2). On the evidence available to BEACN's published review, the request does not clear the bar for spending shared treasury funds.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Phase 1 of 2 for Bifrost, a Bitcoin-Cardano bridge, to move from working testnet to launch readiness through hardening, security audits, formal verification, ecosystem and partner readiness, stewardship, and economic foundations. It asks the treasury for 12332031 ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: Bifrost is designed as a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge secured by Cardano's SPO ecosystem that brings BTC onto Cardano as a native Cardano asset.

A material claim remains proposer-asserted or thinly supported: By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO-threshold custody modes under controlled access.

- finding: Deadline/expiry: 9-month delivery period from July 2026 to March 2027
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Bifrost is designed as a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge secured by Cardano's SPO ecosystem that brings BTC onto Cardano as a native Cardano asset.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests ₳12,332,031, stated as approximately $1,973,125 at 0.16 USD/ADA including a 10% refundable contingency, for a 9-month delivery period.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO-threshold custody modes under controlled access.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): Bifrost's custody model distributes locked BTC across 400+ Cardano SPOs weighted by delegation, with movement requiring a cryptographic threshold representing the majority of delegated stake.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): If SPO coordination fails, Bifrost uses a federated mode as an operational fallback for continuity.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): Bifrost's smart contracts, off-chain tooling, and SDK are released under Apache 2.0 so anyone can audit, fork, run, or build on the bridge without permission.
- missing: Independent evidence for: By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO-threshold custody modes under controlled access.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Bifrost's custody model distributes locked BTC across 400+ Cardano SPOs weighted by delegation, with movement requiring a cryptographic threshold representing the majority of delegated stake.
- missing: Independent evidence for: If SPO coordination fails, Bifrost uses a federated mode as an operational fallback for continuity.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Bifrost's smart contracts, off-chain tooling, and SDK are released under Apache 2.0 so anyone can audit, fork, run, or build on the bridge without permission.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 0
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.72
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Bifrost is designed as a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge secured by Cardano's SPO ecosystem that brings BTC onto Cardano as a native Cardano asset." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO-threshold custody modes under controlled access." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Inferences
- Advisory model lean was -0.020 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: The claims describe potentially high public-benefit infrastructure, but the deterministic assessment says evidence is thin and overall status is incomplete; for a large treasury request involving bridge custody and real BTC risk, the doctrine prioritizes treasury stewardship, protocol safety, and independently verified evidence over plausible ecosystem growth.
- Directional NO is supported by affirmative independent evidence of waste, duplication, excessive cost, or failed delivery — not by missing information.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- Treasury flow signal is in stressed regime (total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals).
- Proposal requests over 50% of rolling available capacity.
- DRep ratification support is below threshold; this is not treated as active opposition.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO-threshold custody modes under controlled access.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: Bifrost's custody model distributes locked BTC across 400+ Cardano SPOs weighted by delegation, with movement requiring a cryptographic threshold representing the majority of delegated stake.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Treasury analysis missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- Treasury analysis missing: sustainability path
