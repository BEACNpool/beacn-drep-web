Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.01` (base + flags + capped margin; LLM lean `+0.005` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.4225` | Readiness: `0.0`
> Reasoning layer (deterministic-heuristic): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a info action: 5 well-supported claim(s), 1 unsupported high-materiality claim(s). Net bounded adjustment +0.005 (clamped to ±0.05).

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records ABSTAIN on Reimburse Ikigai Info Governance Action Deposit. This is a conservative abstention because the evidence does not justify stronger certainty.

The action is a InfoAction. The cached anchor describes the request as: Reimburse Ikigai Info Governance Action Deposit. The strongest grounded claim is: In September 2024, only weeks after the Chang hard fork to introduce on-chain governance, an Info governance action titled Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai - was submitted.

A material claim remains proposer-asserted or thinly supported: There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed. Reason code: RULE_THRESHOLD_UNMET.

- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): In September 2024, only weeks after the Chang hard fork to introduce on-chain governance, an Info governance action titled Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai - was submitted.
- finding: Claim (governance, supported_in_proposal, medium materiality): This was only a symbolic governance action, as it simply asked the community whether they agreed with a statement thanking those that helped get Cardano to this point and expressing a sense of hope for the future.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, medium materiality): Unfortunately, due to a bug in the code of the Cardano node that permitted an unregistered stake key to be used in the governance action, the submitter was unable to recover their deposit of 100K ada.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): While the community expressed at the time the importance of reimbursing this deposit via a treasury withdrawal; once the ability to do so became available, following the Plomin hard fork; unfortunately none of the entity based budget submissions have includ...
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed.
- finding: Claim (economic, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): It was considered that the submitter should not lose one hundred thousand ada, for being an early pioneer of Cardano governance.
- missing: Independent evidence for: There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed.
- missing: Independent evidence for: It was considered that the submitter should not lose one hundred thousand ada, for being an early pioneer of Cardano governance.
- missing: Independent evidence for: This is a budget Info governance action requesting an amount of 103,000 ada.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "In September 2024, only weeks after the Chang hard fork to introduce on-chain governance, an Info governance action titled Cardanoの生きがい - Ikigai - was submitted." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "There was significant sentiment at the time that the Ikigai Info governance action deposit should be reimbursed." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
