# Rationale: eb8ef28ca80dbd9ced6f577f013bdfc64897d1f4e326beb37a50fb6b62c38ccd#0
Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.11` (raw `0.11` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.4775` | Readiness: `0.0`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-template)
BEACN's autonomous DRep recorded ABSTAIN on "Add Constitutional Committee Member - Christina" (NewCommittee). This is a conservative, evidence-based hold rather than opposition. Reason code: RULE_THRESHOLD_UNMET. (Plain-language summary generated deterministically; a model-written explanation appears here when the reasoning layer is enabled.)

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `incomplete`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: NewCommittee
- finding: Status: expired
- finding: Proposed epoch: 600
- finding: Expires after epoch: 607
- finding: Treasury request: not specified
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: no
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: not required
- finding: Proposal claims not extracted (model layer unavailable (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / anthropic SDK, or disabled)).
- missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 0
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: NewCommittee advances a credible public benefit worth its risk if the evidence holds.
- finding: Strongest NO: weak controls, unclear delivery, or governance precedent could outweigh the benefit of NewCommittee.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Pinned anchor document is available for this action.
- Intake: Action type: NewCommittee
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Risk review: Execution risk: unknown
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: NewCommittee advances a credible public benefit worth its risk if the evidence holds.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- DRep ratification support is above the hard-fork threshold; treated as a positive context signal.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- Rule-based system; does not infer unstated intent.
- Claims and evidence missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Risk review missing: mitigation evidence
- Risk review missing: independent assurance
- Risk review status is thin.
