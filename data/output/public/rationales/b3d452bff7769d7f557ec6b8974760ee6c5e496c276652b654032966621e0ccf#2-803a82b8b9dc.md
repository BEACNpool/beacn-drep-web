# Rationale: b3d452bff7769d7f557ec6b8974760ee6c5e496c276652b654032966621e0ccf#2
Recommendation: **YES**
Score: `0.275` (binding treasury composite; advisory raw signal `-0.08`; LLM lean `+0.02` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.7887` | Readiness: `0.85`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The extracted claims describe maintenance of a security-critical access layer with defined scope, budget line items, prior-funding disclosure, NCL assertion, external references, and smart-contract oversight. The nudge is small because several core benefit and continuity claims remain proposer-asserted rather than directly evidenced in the anchor text.

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records YES on Withdraw 1,310,960 ada for Hardware Wallet Maintenance 2026. The deterministic gates found enough evidence and no decisive blocker.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Withdraw treasury funds for Hardware Wallet Maintenance 2026 covering 12 months of production maintenance for Cardano hardware-wallet support. It asks the treasury for 1,310,960 ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: The proposal requests 1,310,960 ada, consisting of 1,272,777 ada for Cardano Hardware Wallet Maintenance & Compatibility Assurance and 38,183 ada for the Intersect Budget Administration fee.

A residual watch item: this claim remains proposer-asserted rather than independently shown: The work is scoped as continuity maintenance for an existing Cardano hardware-wallet access layer rather than building a new wallet product.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: yes
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: complete
- finding: Requested: Withdraw treasury funds for Hardware Wallet Maintenance 2026 covering 12 months of production maintenance for Cardano hardware-wallet support.
- finding: Recipient: Intersect 2026 Treasury Reserve Smart Contract stake address stake1784sdxt6jjennmstphgdu7l7c2scf5d02a6cve2dgn5s2kq5u3j9v, submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor
- finding: Stated amount: 1,310,960
- finding: Deliverables: Ledger and Trezor compatibility updates, Maintenance of supporting interoperability libraries and cardano-hw-cli, Developer support for ecosystem integrators, Support for integration paths involving externally maintained components where shared hardware-wallet flows intersect, Vendor-required product or security audits where firmware or app changes trigger them, Transparent capped time-and-materials reporting, Milestone-based disbursement controls
- finding: Deadline/expiry: 12 months during 2026
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests 1,310,960 ada, consisting of 1,272,777 ada for Cardano Hardware Wallet Maintenance & Compatibility Assurance and 38,183 ada for the Intersect Budget Administration fee.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The work is scoped as continuity maintenance for an existing Cardano hardware-wallet access layer rather than building a new wallet product.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The proposal says continuous maintenance is needed because Cardano protocol evolution and Ledger or Trezor changes can otherwise break secure access for users and integrations.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal states that funded work will include Ledger and Trezor compatibility updates, supporting library and cardano-hw-cli maintenance, integrator support, externally maintained component support, and vendor-required audits.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): The proposal states it achieved the required 67% support threshold during the 2026 Intersect Budget Process Hydra Voting phase.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposer asserts the requested amount does not, at submission, breach the applicable 350M ada Net Change Limit covering Epoch 613 to Epoch 713.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The work is scoped as continuity maintenance for an existing Cardano hardware-wallet access layer rather than building a new wallet product.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal says continuous maintenance is needed because Cardano protocol evolution and Ledger or Trezor changes can otherwise break secure access for users and integrations.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 0
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.66
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: medium
- finding: Technical risk: medium
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: medium
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal requests 1,310,960 ada, consisting of 1,272,777 ada for Cardano Hardware Wallet Maintenance & Compatibility Assurance and 38,183 ada for the Intersect Budget Administration fee." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "The work is scoped as continuity maintenance for an existing Cardano hardware-wallet access layer rather than building a new wallet product." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Inferences
- DRep ratification support is material but below threshold; treated as a modest context signal.
- Advisory model lean was +0.020 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: The extracted claims describe maintenance of a security-critical access layer with defined scope, budget line items, prior-funding disclosure, NCL assertion, external references, and smart-contract oversight. The nudge is small because several core benefit and continuity claims remain proposer-asserted rather than directly evidenced in the anchor text.
- Directional YES cleared ecosystem benefit, delivery, cost-efficiency, downside-protection, and portfolio-capacity floors.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
