Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `0.01` (base + flags + capped margin; LLM lean `+0.02` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.5725` | Readiness: `0.0`
> Reasoning layer (deterministic-heuristic): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a constitution action: 8 well-supported claim(s), constitution doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment +0.020 (clamped to ±0.05).

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records ABSTAIN on CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.3. This is a conservative abstention because the evidence does not justify stronger certainty.

The action is a NewConstitution. The cached anchor describes the request as: CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.3. The strongest grounded claim is: Cardano Constitution v2.3 removes non-binding expectations, the Budget Info Action mechanism, and mandatory CC conduct rules, streamlining governance.

Reason code: RULE_THRESHOLD_UNMET.

- finding: Deadline/expiry: not stated in document
- finding: Claim (economic, independently_verifiable, high materiality): Cardano Constitution v2.3 removes non-binding expectations, the Budget Info Action mechanism, and mandatory CC conduct rules, streamlining governance.
- finding: Claim (other, independently_verifiable, high materiality): It adds clear definitions, enforces immutability of proposal documents, and applies treasury audit/accountability safeguards to all withdrawals.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): Community review of v2.0 had 86.23% DRep participation, and v2.3 incorporates feedback and improvements, addressing prior concerns to reinforce legitimacy and broad input.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION v2.3 https://ipfs.io/ipfs/bafkreihjgclyeemuvvn27mil5whoexjsuhn3fuwgjefawwbonmwo6hsxsq 2.
- finding: Claim (economic, independently_verifiable, high materiality): Simplify governance by removing non-binding expectations and redundant mechanisms like Budget Info Action.
- finding: Claim (other, independently_verifiable, low materiality): Improve clarity and consistency through unified terminology, added definitions, and streamlined provisions.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Cardano Constitution v2.3 removes non-binding expectations, the Budget Info Action mechanism, and mandatory CC conduct rules, streamlining governance." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: weak controls, unclear delivery, or governance precedent could outweigh the benefit of NewConstitution.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Pinned anchor document is available for this action.
- Flag score present (3), reducing confidence.
- Intake: Action type: NewConstitution
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Risk review: Execution risk: unknown
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Cardano Constitution v2.3 removes non-binding expectations, the Budget Info Action mechanism, and mandatory CC conduct rules, streamlining governance." and clears the evidence gates.

## Inferences
- DRep ratification support is above the hard-fork threshold; treated as a positive context signal.
- Advisory model lean was +0.020 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: Doctrine-aware offline lean for a constitution action: 8 well-supported claim(s), constitution doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment +0.020 (clamped to ±0.05).
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
