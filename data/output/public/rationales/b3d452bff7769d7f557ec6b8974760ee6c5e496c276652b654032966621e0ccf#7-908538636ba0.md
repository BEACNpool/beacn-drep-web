Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `0.027` (raw `-0.08` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.7268` | Readiness: `0.65`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The extracted claims show a plausible public-benefit infrastructure maintenance case with concrete scope, budget breakdown, governance-process references, NCL assertion, and fund-control mechanics, while key adoption and delivery-history claims remain partly proposer-asserted; this balance is already the kind of evidence and stewardship tradeoff the deterministic assessment tree is meant to capture, so no additional nudge is justified.

## Plain-language explanation (precomputed)
BEACN voted NEEDS_MORE_INFO because this treasury withdrawal needs independently pinned Net Change Limit evidence before a directional vote can be justified. This is a conservative, evidence-based hold, not a rejection of Oura or the maintenance work.

The action requests 540,750 ada for 12 months of Oura maintenance and enhancement by TxPipe, submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The proposal says this includes 525,000 ada for the work itself and a 15,750 ada Intersect administration fee, with the work covering a part-time maintainer, dependency updates, Cardano protocol compatibility, performance improvements, bug fixing, documentation, issue triage, contribution review, ecosystem-feedback-driven enhancements, public communication, and AI-friendly integration resources.

Several core claims were well-supported by the proposal or independently verifiable: Oura’s technical role as a Rust-native Cardano event pipeline, the requested amount and stated budget basis, the pinned and replayable proposal anchor, the Intersect Budget Process support threshold, and the smart-contract-based treasury administration structure. Other claims were not yet strong enough for high-confidence approval, including independent evidence that Oura is used across the ecosystem for indexing, monitoring, analytics, and real-time event processing, and independent evidence for TxPipe’s stated Catalyst delivery record.

The review gates passed far enough to show the proposal can be assessed, and the strongest YES case is that the basic funding request and purpose are substantiated. But treasury withdrawals consume shared ada and require a higher evidence bar. A directional vote would be unblocked by pinned, independently verifiable public chain evidence for the applicable Net Change Limit, plus stronger support for the thin claims, a line-item budget, milestone-gated disbursement, independent assurance, and a rollback or remedy path.

- finding: Deadline/expiry: 12 months
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests 420,000 ADA plus a 105,000 ADA contingency reserve for a part-time Oura maintainer over 12 months at an annual rate of $105,000 USD.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The total requested withdrawal is 540,750 ADA, consisting of 525,000 ADA for Oura maintenance and enhancement and a 15,750 ADA Intersect Budget Administration fee.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Oura is a Rust-native pipeline tool that connects to Cardano nodes, monitors blockchain events, and routes matching patterns to pluggable outputs for processing.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, medium materiality): Oura supports multiple data sources including N2C, N2N, S3, Mithril, and UTxO RPC, and supports sinks including Kafka, Elasticsearch, AWS services, RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL databases, and webhooks.
- finding: Claim (adoption, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): The proposal states that Oura has 654 commits, 288 stars, 79 forks, and 58 contributors and identifies it as the most starred project in the TxPipe portfolio.
- finding: Claim (adoption, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The proposal states that Oura is used across the ecosystem for indexing, monitoring, analytics, and real-time event processing.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal states that Oura is used across the ecosystem for indexing, monitoring, analytics, and real-time event processing.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal states that TxPipe has received funding through 30 Project Catalyst proposals from Funds 9 through 14, with 26 delivered and 4 under development and on schedule.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 540750
- finding: Budget granularity: not confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown

- finding: Financial confidence: 0.43
- missing: line-item budget
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review

- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed

- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal requests 420,000 ADA plus a 105,000 ADA contingency reserve for a part-time Oura maintainer over 12 months at an annual rate of $105,000 USD." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "The proposal states that Oura is used across the ecosystem for indexing, monitoring, analytics, and real-time event processing." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
