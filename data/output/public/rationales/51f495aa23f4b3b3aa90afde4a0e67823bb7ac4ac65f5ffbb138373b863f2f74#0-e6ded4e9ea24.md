# Rationale: 51f495aa23f4b3b3aa90afde4a0e67823bb7ac4ac65f5ffbb138373b863f2f74#0
Recommendation: **ABSTAIN**
Score: `-0.3833` (base + flags + capped margin; LLM lean `-0.02` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.4158` | Readiness: `0.0`
> Reasoning layer (deterministic-heuristic): Doctrine-aware offline lean for a parameter action: parameter doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment -0.020 (clamped to ±0.05).

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records ABSTAIN on 51f495aa23f4b3b3aa90afde4a0e67823bb7ac4ac65f5ffbb138373b863f2f74#0. This is a conservative abstention because the evidence does not justify stronger certainty.

The action is a ParameterChange. The cached anchor describes the request as: not stated.

Reason code: RISK_HIGH.

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `incomplete`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: ParameterChange
- finding: Status: expired
- finding: Proposed epoch: 518
- finding: Expires after epoch: 525
- finding: Treasury request: not specified
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: no
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: not pinned
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: no
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: not required
- finding: Proposal claims not extracted (no cached anchor document text to read).
- missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `thin`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: unknown
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: ParameterChange advances a credible public benefit worth its risk if the evidence holds.
- finding: Strongest NO: weak controls, unclear delivery, or governance precedent could outweigh the benefit of ParameterChange.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Protocol parameter changes carry system-wide risk.
- Flag score present (10), reducing confidence.
- Intake: Action type: ParameterChange
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: not pinned
- Risk review: Execution risk: unknown
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: ParameterChange advances a credible public benefit worth its risk if the evidence holds.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- Advisory model lean was -0.020 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: Doctrine-aware offline lean for a parameter action: parameter doctrine demands elevated scrutiny. Net bounded adjustment -0.020 (clamped to ±0.05).
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- Anchor document is not yet pinned locally for this action.
- No DRep distribution available.
- High risk flags triggered conservative abstain.
- Claims and evidence missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Risk review missing: mitigation evidence
- Risk review missing: independent assurance
- Risk review status is thin.
