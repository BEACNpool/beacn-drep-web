Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `0.0` (binding treasury composite; advisory raw signal `0.0`; LLM lean `+0.0` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.2` | Readiness: `0`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records NEEDS_MORE_INFO on Withdraw ₳45,217 for MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix. This is an evidence hold, not opposition: BEACN cannot make a directional treasury judgment from the current record.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Withdraw ₳45,217 for MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix. It asks the treasury for 45.2k ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: This treasury withdrawal funds MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix which will provide the following services: This proposal seeks annual funding for the maintenance and enhancement of Cardano.nix, a foundational toolset for building and d.

BEACN's own independent diligence is also incomplete — before this vote could move to YES, BEACN's published review still needs complete proposal summary; budget analysis; feasibility assessment. Reason code: DEEP_RESEARCH_REQUIRED.

- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "This treasury withdrawal funds MLabs Core Tool Maintenance & Enhancement: Cardano.nix which will provide the following services: This proposal seeks annual funding for the maintenance and enhancement of Cardano.nix, a foundational toolset for building and d..." though 7 review blocker(s) remain open.
- finding: Strongest NO: an unresolved blocker (missing complete proposal summary) means costs or weak controls may outweigh the claimed benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: a treasury action without a complete deep-research dossier cannot be voted directionally without pretending certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis

- missing: missing feasibility assessment
- missing: missing risk analysis
- missing: missing alternatives analysis
- missing: missing failure-mode analysis
- missing: missing community impact analysis
