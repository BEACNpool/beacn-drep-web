Recommendation: **NO**
Score: `-0.1475` (binding treasury composite; advisory raw signal `-0.56`; LLM lean `-0.02` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.7569` | Readiness: `0.75`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The claims describe potentially high public-benefit infrastructure, but the deterministic assessment says evidence is thin and overall status is incomplete; under the doctrine, large treasury spending with incomplete independently verified diligence should be nudged cautiously rather than toward spending.

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records NO on Bifrost: Unlocking Bitcoin DeFi on Cardano — Road to Mainnet (Phase 1 of 2). On the evidence available to BEACN's published review, the request does not clear the bar for spending shared treasury funds.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Phase 1 of 2 for Bifrost, a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge, covering launch-readiness work including hardening, security audits, formal verification, ecosystem and partner readiness, and stewardship and economic foundations. It asks the treasury for 12332031 ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: Bifrost is designed as a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge secured by Cardano's existing SPO ecosystem that brings BTC onto Cardano as a native Cardano asset.

A material claim remains proposer-asserted or thinly supported: By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO threshold custody modes under controlled access.

- finding: Deliverables: Audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO threshold custody modes under controlled access, Hardening and security audits, Formal verification, Ecosystem and partner readiness, Stewardship structure, Hardened economic model, SPO/dApp partner pipeline required for public launch
- finding: Deadline/expiry: 9-month delivery period from July 2026 to March 2027
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Bifrost is designed as a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge secured by Cardano's existing SPO ecosystem that brings BTC onto Cardano as a native Cardano asset.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests ₳12,332,031, approximately $1,973,125 at 0.16 USD/ADA, including a 10% refundable contingency, for a 9-month Phase 1 delivery period from July 2026 to March 2027.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO threshold custody modes under controlled access.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, high materiality): Public rollout and 24 months of operations are intentionally separated into a Phase 2 proposal planned for Q1 2027 after the bridge has been proven on-chain.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Bifrost custody of locked BTC is described as distributed across 400+ Cardano SPOs weighted by delegation, with funds moved by a cryptographic threshold of SPOs representing the majority of delegated stake.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): If SPO coordination fails, Bifrost includes a federated mode as an operational fallback continuity layer.
- missing: Independent evidence for: By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO threshold custody modes under controlled access.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Public rollout and 24 months of operations are intentionally separated into a Phase 2 proposal planned for Q1 2027 after the bridge has been proven on-chain.
- missing: Independent evidence for: If SPO coordination fails, Bifrost includes a federated mode as an operational fallback continuity layer.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Bifrost is already live on testnet under Catalyst Fund 14, with working peg-ins and peg-outs and participating SPOs.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 0
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.72
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Bifrost is designed as a permissionless Bitcoin-Cardano bridge secured by Cardano's existing SPO ecosystem that brings BTC onto Cardano as a native Cardano asset." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO threshold custody modes under controlled access." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Inferences
- Advisory model lean was -0.020 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: The claims describe potentially high public-benefit infrastructure, but the deterministic assessment says evidence is thin and overall status is incomplete; under the doctrine, large treasury spending with incomplete independently verified diligence should be nudged cautiously rather than toward spending.
- Directional NO is supported by affirmative independent evidence of waste, duplication, excessive cost, or failed delivery — not by missing information.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- Treasury flow signal is in stressed regime (total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals).
- Proposal requests over 50% of rolling available capacity.
- DRep ratification support is below threshold; this is not treated as active opposition.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: By the end of Phase 1, Bifrost will be an audited bridge running on Cardano mainnet in both federated and SPO threshold custody modes under controlled access.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: Public rollout and 24 months of operations are intentionally separated into a Phase 2 proposal planned for Q1 2027 after the bridge has been proven on-chain.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Treasury analysis missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- Treasury analysis missing: sustainability path
- Risk review missing: independent assurance
- Risk review missing: rollback/remedy path
