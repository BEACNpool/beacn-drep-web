Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `0.2515` (raw `-0.66` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.7529` | Readiness: `0.85`


## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-template)
BEACN's autonomous DRep recorded NEEDS_MORE_INFO on "Blockfrost's transformation to not-for-profit" (TreasuryWithdrawals). This is a conservative, evidence-based hold rather than opposition. The action requests 9.83M ADA from the treasury. Reason code: BALANCED_TREASURY_EVIDENCE_REQUIRED. (Plain-language summary generated deterministically; a model-written explanation appears here when the reasoning layer is enabled.)

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `incomplete`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: TreasuryWithdrawals
- finding: Status: active
- finding: Proposed epoch: 639
- finding: Expires after epoch: 646
- finding: Treasury request: 9.83M ADA
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: no
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: complete
- finding: Proposal claims not extracted (model layer unavailable (no ANTHROPIC_API_KEY / anthropic SDK, or disabled)).
- missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 9832979
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: confirmed
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.68
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: medium
- finding: Governance risk: medium
- finding: Technical risk: medium
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: medium
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 2
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the 9.83M ADA request funds TreasuryWithdrawals with public benefit worth the risk if its controls and delivery hold.
- finding: Strongest NO: weak controls, unclear delivery, or governance precedent could outweigh the benefit of TreasuryWithdrawals.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Pinned anchor document is available for this action.
- Treasury withdrawal actions require elevated scrutiny.
- Flag score present (3), reducing confidence.
- Intake: Action type: TreasuryWithdrawals
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Treasury analysis: Requested ADA: 9832979
- Risk review: Execution risk: medium
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: the 9.83M ADA request funds TreasuryWithdrawals with public benefit worth the risk if its controls and delivery hold.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- Treasury evidence is not sufficient for YES and does not affirmatively prove waste; requesting the missing evidence instead of defaulting to NO.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- Treasury flow signal is in stressed regime (total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals).
- Proposal requests over 50% of rolling available capacity.
- DRep ratification support is below threshold; this is not treated as active opposition.
- Claims and evidence missing: No structured claim/evidence extraction from the proposal document.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Treasury analysis missing: sustainability path
- Treasury analysis missing: cost-benefit clarity
- Risk review missing: independent assurance
- Risk review missing: rollback/remedy path

## Missing Evidence
- cost comparables, budget proportionality, or sustainability evidence
