Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `-0.2133` (raw `-0.2133` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.02`) | Confidence: `0.7733` | Readiness: `0.85`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): A small positive adjustment is justified because the claims show unusually concrete treasury-control details for a large withdrawal, including disclosed prior funding, work-package amounts, smart contract addresses, sign-off thresholds, external references, and assurance mechanisms. The adjustment remains small because several high-materiality operational-performance claims are still proposer asserted and the ask is large.

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records NEEDS_MORE_INFO on Withdraw 25,400,000 ada for Intersect: Governance coordination and technical . This is an evidence hold, not opposition: BEACN cannot make a directional treasury judgment from the current record.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Treasury withdrawal to fund Intersect governance coordination, technical stewardship, incident response, release coordination, ecosystem operations, and management of critical processes for June 2026 to June 2027. It asks the treasury for 25,400,000 ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: Intersect requests 25,400,000 ADA for its core operating model covering June 2026 to June 2027.

A material claim remains proposer-asserted or thinly supported: Intersect states that the current ask is reduced from last year's $7.875M to $6.35M while preserving functions critical to Cardano continuity and maturity. Reason code: VERIFIED_NCL_REQUIRED.

- finding: Deep research dossier: complete
- finding: Requested: Treasury withdrawal to fund Intersect governance coordination, technical stewardship, incident response, release coordination, ecosystem operations, and management of critical processes for June 2026 to June 2027.
- finding: Recipient: Intersect, paid to the stated 2026 Treasury Reserve Smart Contract stake address
- finding: Stated amount: 25,400,000
- finding: Deliverables: WP 1 - Intersect operations and ecosystem coordination: 6,000,000 ADA, WP 2 - Technical Stewardship, Incident Response & Coordination including core Cardano repos: 18,800,000 ADA, WP 3 - Management of critical processes: 600,000 ADA, Use of treasury management smart contracts with reserve and project-specific contract addresses, Milestone-based drawdowns, evidence-backed reporting, transparent disclosures, and external assurance
- finding: Deadline/expiry: June 2026 to June 2027
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Intersect requests 25,400,000 ADA for its core operating model covering June 2026 to June 2027.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The budget is allocated as 6,000,000 ADA for operations and ecosystem coordination, 18,800,000 ADA for technical stewardship and incident response, and 600,000 ADA for management of critical processes.
- finding: Claim (economic, proposer_asserted, medium materiality): Intersect states that the current ask is reduced from last year's $7.875M to $6.35M while preserving functions critical to Cardano continuity and maturity.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): Intersect says it has coordinated two network upgrades, is preparing for a third, and led ecosystem coordination during the November 2025 chain partition incident.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal states that Intersect supports core Cardano Haskell repositories, release coordination, incident response, repository management, security initiatives, committees, and working groups.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposal states it achieved the required 67% support threshold during the 2026 Intersect Budget Process Hydra Voting phase and provides references to voting, documentation, audited results, and an audit report.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Intersect states that the current ask is reduced from last year's $7.875M to $6.35M while preserving functions critical to Cardano continuity and maturity.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Intersect says it has coordinated two network upgrades, is preparing for a third, and led ecosystem coordination during the November 2025 chain partition incident.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 25400000
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.64
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Intersect requests 25,400,000 ADA for its core operating model covering June 2026 to June 2027." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "Intersect states that the current ask is reduced from last year's $7.875M to $6.35M while preserving functions critical to Cardano continuity and maturity." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Inferences
- DRep ratification support is material but below threshold; treated as a modest context signal.
- Doctrine-aware reasoning layer nudged the score by +0.020 (clamped to ±0.05): A small positive adjustment is justified because the claims show unusually concrete treasury-control details for a large withdrawal, including disclosed prior funding, work-package amounts, smart contract addresses, sign-off thresholds, external references, and assurance mechanisms. The adjustment remains small because several high-materiality operational-performance claims are still proposer asserted and the ask is large.
- Directional treasury voting is blocked until the applicable Net Change Limit is pinned and independently verified from public chain evidence.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
