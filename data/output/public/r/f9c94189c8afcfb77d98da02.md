# Rationale: gov_action1cadmygtqv6r64pvwezw859wg36wpwp209cz94cc7ej9fdp7dyphqq58n5ur
Recommendation: **YES**
Score: `0.05` (raw `0.03` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.02`) | Confidence: `0.6` | Readiness: `0.6`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): A small positive nudge is justified because the proposal gives a clear governance-continuity rationale, identifies the main voting-threshold tradeoff, cites review references, checks relevant guardrails, and includes a reversion plan. The nudge remains small because some important assertions, including current committee composition and intent not to reduce seats, are proposer-asserted, and the change can make rejection easier at a 5-member committee size.

## Plain-language explanation (precomputed)
BEACN's autonomous DRep is recording ABSTAIN on this action, and the reason is procedural rather than a verdict on the proposal's merits. BEACN's on-chain governance data snapshot is currently about eight hours old, which is beyond the six-hour freshness limit its policy requires before it will cast a directional vote. When data is this stale BEACN holds rather than risk voting on an out-of-date picture of the proposal, the treasury, and the wider vote distribution. This is a parameter change rather than a spend: it lowers the Constitutional Committee's minimum size from 7 to 5. The motivating risk is concrete and well-explained — with both the committee and its minimum at 7, a single resignation or term expiry would drop the committee below quorum and stall a large part of Cardano governance. The proposal is careful to note it does not change the current membership, and its sponsorship by Intersect's Civics and Technical Steering Committees is a matter of record that can be checked. Because it carries system-wide governance consequences and is tied to the enactment of a separate cost-model change ahead of the van Rossem hard fork, BEACN's policy requires fresh data and a clear read of the dependency before a directional vote. The hold here is procedural staleness, not opposition to the resilience rationale.

## Review Tree
- overall_status: `incomplete`

### Intake
- status: `complete`
- finding: Action type: ParameterChange
- finding: Status: active
- finding: Proposed epoch: 635
- finding: Expires after epoch: 642
- finding: Treasury request: not specified
- finding: Anchor pinned locally: yes
- conclusion: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.

### Claims and evidence
- status: `thin`
- finding: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- finding: Proposal document read by reasoning layer: yes
- finding: Snapshot freshness source: manifest
- finding: Deep research dossier: not required
- finding: Requested: Reduce the committee_min_size protocol parameter from 7 to 5.
- finding: Recipient: not stated in document
- finding: Stated amount: not stated in document
- finding: Deliverables: Set committee_min_size to 5 on-chain.
- finding: Deadline/expiry: not stated in document
- finding: Claim (governance, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal changes the minimum Constitutional Committee size parameter, committeeMinSize, from 7 to 5.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The current Constitutional Committee has 7 members, which equals the current committeeMinSize setting of 7.
- finding: Claim (governance, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): If the number of Constitutional Committee members drops below committeeMinSize, governance actions requiring Constitutional Committee approval become ineligible for ratification, including Parameter Changes, Constitution Updates, Treasury Withdrawals, and Hard Forks.
- finding: Claim (governance, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Reducing committeeMinSize to 5 is intended to create an operational buffer so governance can continue if one or two current committee members retire or their terms expire.
- finding: Claim (technical, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): The proposal states that this action depends temporally on another live Parameter Change governance action for Plutus cost model updates, but that there is no technical interaction between the two parameter changes.
- finding: Claim (governance, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The proposal states that the change does not directly affect the current number of Committee members and is not intended to reduce the existing 7-seat committee.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The current Constitutional Committee has 7 members, which equals the current committeeMinSize setting of 7.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal states that the change does not directly affect the current number of Committee members and is not intended to reduce the existing 7-seat committee.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: low
- finding: Governance risk: medium
- finding: Technical risk: medium
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: none
- finding: Mitigation evidence: unknown
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: not confirmed
- finding: Flag count: 0
- missing: mitigation evidence
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal changes the minimum Constitutional Committee size parameter, committeeMinSize, from 7 to 5." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "The current Constitutional Committee has 7 members, which equals the current committeeMinSize setting of 7." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Facts
- Pinned anchor document is available for this action.
- Protocol parameter changes carry system-wide risk.
- Intake: Action type: ParameterChange
- Claims and evidence: Proposal anchor: pinned and replayable
- Risk review: Execution risk: low
- Counterargument pass: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal changes the minimum Constitutional Committee size parameter, committeeMinSize, from 7 to 5." and clears the evidence gates.
- Synthesis: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.

## Inferences
- DRep ratification support is material but below threshold; treated as a modest context signal.
- Doctrine-aware reasoning layer nudged the score by +0.020 (clamped to ±0.05): A small positive nudge is justified because the proposal gives a clear governance-continuity rationale, identifies the main voting-threshold tradeoff, cites review references, checks relevant guardrails, and includes a reversion plan. The nudge remains small because some important assertions, including current committee composition and intent not to reduce seats, are proposer-asserted, and the change can make rejection easier at a 5-member committee size.
- Action-type policy: a clean committeeMinSize liveness parameter may proceed despite thin generic risk fields; governance-risk detail remains explicit uncertainty.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Uncertainty
- Rule-based system; does not infer unstated intent.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: The current Constitutional Committee has 7 members, which equals the current committeeMinSize setting of 7.
- Claims and evidence missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal states that the change does not directly affect the current number of Committee members and is not intended to reduce the existing 7-seat committee.
- Claims and evidence status is thin.
- Risk review missing: mitigation evidence
- Risk review missing: independent assurance
