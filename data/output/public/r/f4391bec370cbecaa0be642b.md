# Rationale: gov_action1k02990lhw6wh74t7c6ufw3mqaek9ujtvyan99dj5qv5kvcs7pn8syhyg4hw
Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `-0.2133` (raw `-0.2133` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.7733` | Readiness: `0.85`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The claims describe a security-relevant maintenance function with public-benefit alignment and several independently checkable governance and funds-control references, while the anchor text itself provides limited concrete vendor, milestone, and cost-basis detail for the requested amount. Those positives and cautions appear already captured by the deterministic treasury and evidence review, so no additional nudge is justified.

## Plain-language explanation (precomputed)
BEACN voted NEEDS_MORE_INFO because a directional treasury vote is blocked until the applicable Net Change Limit is pinned and independently verified from public chain evidence.

This action asks to withdraw 1,310,960 ada for 12 months of 2026 hardware-wallet maintenance, with 1,272,777 ada for maintenance and compatibility assurance and 38,183 ada for Intersect budget administration. The requested work includes Ledger and Trezor compatibility updates, supporting libraries and cardano-hw-cli, developer support, vendor-required audits when triggered, capped time-and-materials reporting, and milestone-based disbursement controls. The proposal says the work is maintenance and compatibility support, not a new wallet product, and says continuous support is needed so users and integrators are not stranded by Cardano, Ledger, or Trezor changes.

Some parts were well-supported: the pinned proposal anchor was available and replayable, the requested amount and fee split were substantiated, Intersect’s budget-process support threshold was referenced, oversight and smart-contract administration were described, and prior related funding was disclosed through listed links. But key claims remained thin or unsupported by independent evidence, including the scope claim that the work is limited to maintenance and compatibility, the claim that continuous maintenance is necessary to prevent broken secure access, and the broader cost-benefit and sustainability case. The review also found unknown execution risk, missing independent assurance, and no clear rollback or remedy path.

This is a conservative, evidence-based hold, not a rejection of hardware-wallet maintenance. A directional vote would be unblocked by pinned, independently verifiable public-chain evidence for the applicable Net Change Limit, plus stronger independent evidence for the maintenance scope, necessity of continuous support, sustainability path, cost-benefit clarity, execution assurance, and remedy path.

- finding: Snapshot freshness source: deep_research_dossiers.csv
- finding: Deep research dossier: complete
- finding: Requested: Treasury withdrawal to fund Hardware Wallet Maintenance 2026 for 12 months of production maintenance of Cardano hardware-wallet support.
- finding: Recipient: Intersect 2026 Treasury Reserve Smart Contract stake address stake1784sdxt6jjennmstphgdu7l7c2scf5d02a6cve2dgn5s2kq5u3j9v, submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor.
- finding: Stated amount: 1,310,960
- finding: Deliverables: Ledger and Trezor compatibility updates, maintenance of supporting interoperability libraries and cardano-hw-cli, developer support for ecosystem integrators, support for integration paths involving externally maintained components where shared hardware-wallet flows intersect, vendor-required product or security audits where firmware or app changes trigger them, transparent capped time-and-materials reporting, milestone-based disbursement controls
- finding: Deadline/expiry: 12 months during 2026
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests 1,310,960 ada, consisting of 1,272,777 ada for Cardano Hardware Wallet Maintenance & Compatibility Assurance and 38,183 ada for the Intersect Budget Administration fee.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The funded work is limited to compatibility, security, supporting libraries/tooling, release support, and vendor-required audit work for hardware-wallet flows rather than building a new wallet product.
- finding: Claim (technical, proposer_asserted, high materiality): Cardano hardware-wallet support must be maintained continuously or users and integrators may lose secure access when Cardano, Ledger, or Trezor introduce breaking changes.
- finding: Claim (adoption, proposer_asserted, high materiality): The proposal says it will preserve secure signing, avoid broken integrations, prevent protocol and vendor changes from stranding hardware-wallet users, and support maintained hardware-wallet paths for newer utility layers.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposal states it achieved the required 67% support threshold during the 2026 Intersect Budget Process Hydra Voting phase and provides references to voting documentation, audited results, and an audit report.
- finding: Claim (governance, independently_verifiable, high materiality): The proposer states the requested amount does not, at submission, breach the applicable 350M Net Change Limit for Epoch 613 to Epoch 713 and links to the relevant governance action.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The funded work is limited to compatibility, security, supporting libraries/tooling, release support, and vendor-required audit work for hardware-wallet flows rather than building a new wallet product.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Cardano hardware-wallet support must be maintained continuously or users and integrators may lose secure access when Cardano, Ledger, or Trezor introduce breaking changes.
- missing: Independent evidence for: The proposal says it will preserve secure signing, avoid broken integrations, prevent protocol and vendor changes from stranding hardware-wallet users, and support maintained hardware-wallet paths for newer utility layers.
- missing: Independent evidence for: Audit and oversight costs are included within the overhead and administration fee, with independent oversight through Intersect and technically capable third parties.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 1310960
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: confirmed
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.62
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal requests 1,310,960 ada, consisting of 1,272,777 ada for Cardano Hardware Wallet Maintenance & Compatibility Assurance and 38,183 ada for the Intersect Budget Administration fee." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "The funded work is limited to compatibility, security, supporting libraries/tooling, release support, and vendor-required audit work for hardware-wallet flows rather than building a new wallet product." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
