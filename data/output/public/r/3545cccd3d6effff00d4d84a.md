# Rationale: b3d452bff7769d7f557ec6b8974760ee6c5e496c276652b654032966621e0ccf#7
Recommendation: **NEEDS_MORE_INFO**
Score: `0.027` (binding treasury composite; advisory raw signal `-0.08`; LLM lean `+0.02` recorded, not added) | Confidence: `0.7268` | Readiness: `0.65`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): A small positive nudge is justified because the claims describe maintenance of established open-source infrastructure with concrete technical scope, public repository/adoption indicators, NCL compliance references, and structured fund administration; the nudge remains small because several delivery-history and on-schedule claims are proposer asserted rather than evidenced in the document.

## Plain-language explanation (precomputed)
BEACN voted NEEDS_MORE_INFO because this is a Treasury withdrawal and a directional vote is blocked until the applicable Net Change Limit is pinned and independently verified from public chain evidence.

The action asks to withdraw 540,750 ada for 12 months of Oura by TxPipe maintenance, submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The proposal says the funding covers a part-time maintainer, dependency updates, Cardano protocol compatibility, performance improvements, bug fixes, documentation, community support, and AI-friendly integration resources. Several core points were supported: the proposal anchor was pinned and replayable, the requested amount was clear, Oura’s technical role was described, public repository and adoption indicators were independently verifiable, Intersect Budget Process support was independently verifiable, and the fund administration structure was described.

The review also found important gaps. Some delivery-history claims were proposer asserted rather than independently evidenced, including prior Project Catalyst funding for Oura and TxPipe’s broader Catalyst delivery record. The claims-and-evidence status was thin, and the treasury review was missing a line-item budget and milestone-gated disbursement detail. The risk review also lacked independent assurance and a rollback or remedy path, with execution risk marked unknown.

This is a conservative, evidence-based hold rather than a rejection of Oura or its proposed maintenance work. A directional vote would be unblocked by pinned, independently verifiable public chain evidence for the applicable Net Change Limit, plus stronger independent evidence for the unsupported funding and delivery-history claims, clearer budget detail, milestone-gated disbursement evidence, independent assurance, and a defined remedy path.

- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal requests 420,000 ADA plus a 105,000 ADA contingency reserve to fund a part-time Oura maintainer over 12 months at an annual rate of $105,000 USD.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The on-chain withdrawal amount is 540,750 ADA, consisting of 525,000 ADA for Oura maintenance and enhancement plus a 15,750 ADA Intersect Budget Administration fee.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Oura is a Rust-native pipeline tool that connects to Cardano nodes, monitors blockchain events, and routes matching patterns to pluggable outputs.
- finding: Claim (technical, supported_in_proposal, medium materiality): Oura supports multiple data sources including N2C, N2N, S3, Mithril, and UTxO RPC, and multiple sinks including Kafka, Elasticsearch, AWS services, RabbitMQ, Redis, SQL databases, and webhooks.
- finding: Claim (adoption, independently_verifiable, medium materiality): Oura has 654 commits, 288 stars, 79 forks, and 58 contributors, and is described as the most starred project in the TxPipe portfolio.

- missing: Independent evidence for: Oura has previously been funded twice through Project Catalyst, in Fund 9 and Fund 13, for feature development.
- missing: Independent evidence for: TxPipe has received funding through 30 Project Catalyst proposals across Funds 9 through 14, with 26 successfully delivered and 4 currently under development and on schedule.
- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 540750
- finding: Budget granularity: not confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: unknown
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown

- finding: Financial confidence: 0.43
- missing: line-item budget
- missing: milestone-gated disbursement
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review

- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed

- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "The proposal requests 420,000 ADA plus a 105,000 ADA contingency reserve to fund a part-time Oura maintainer over 12 months at an annual rate of $105,000 USD." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "Oura has previously been funded twice through Project Catalyst, in Fund 9 and Fund 13, for feature development." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.

## Inferences
- DRep ratification support is material but below threshold; treated as a modest context signal.
- Advisory model lean was +0.020 (display cap ±0.05) and had zero influence on the binding score: A small positive nudge is justified because the claims describe maintenance of established open-source infrastructure with concrete technical scope, public repository/adoption indicators, NCL compliance references, and structured fund administration; the nudge remains small because several delivery-history and on-schedule claims are proposer asserted rather than evidenced in the document.
- Treasury evidence is not sufficient for YES and does not affirmatively prove waste; requesting the missing evidence instead of defaulting to NO.
- Intake: Baseline fields and source anchors establish whether the proposal can be reviewed at all.
- Claims and evidence: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.
- Treasury analysis: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.
- Risk review: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.
- Counterargument pass: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.
- Synthesis: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
