# Rationale: b3d452bff7769d7f557ec6b8974760ee6c5e496c276652b654032966621e0ccf#3
Recommendation: **YES**
Score: `0.189` (raw `-0.08` + doctrine-LLM nudge `+0.0`) | Confidence: `0.7672` | Readiness: `0.85`
> Reasoning layer (precomputed): The extracted claims show a relatively detailed treasury request with work-package amounts, governance-process references, smart-contract custody details, oversight structure, and external verification hooks, but the deterministic assessment has already marked claims, treasury analysis, and risk review complete. No additional doctrine-based nudge is warranted beyond the mechanical assessment because the main evidence-quality and treasury-stewardship factors are already captured.

## Plain-language explanation (deterministic-heuristic)
BEACN records YES on Withdraw 1,193,000 ada for Intersect Technical Steering Committee Support. The deterministic gates found enough evidence and no decisive blocker.

The action is a TreasuryWithdrawals. The cached anchor describes the request as: Treasury withdrawal to fund Intersect Technical Steering Committee Support for 12 months. It asks the treasury for 1,193,000 ADA. The strongest grounded claim is: Intersect requests 1,193,000 ADA, stated as $298,250, to support Technical Steering Committee activities for 12 months.

A residual watch item: this claim remains proposer-asserted rather than independently shown: The proposal says all expenditure will be fully accounted for and unspent funds will be returned to the Cardano treasury.

- finding: Deadline/expiry: 12 months; WP3 pilot launching in 2027
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): Intersect requests 1,193,000 ADA, stated as $298,250, to support Technical Steering Committee activities for 12 months.
- finding: Claim (economic, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): The proposal allocates 256,000 ADA to WP1, 832,000 ADA to WP2, and 105,000 ADA to WP3, totaling 1,193,000 ADA.
- finding: Claim (governance, supported_in_proposal, high materiality): WP2 will fund the Parameter Committee, CIP editors, and Hard Fork Working Group to support protocol governance and evolution.

- conclusion: Each claim must map to replayable public evidence; proposer assertions alone are not enough for confidence.

### Treasury analysis
- status: `complete`
- finding: Requested ADA: 1193000
- finding: Budget granularity: confirmed
- finding: Milestone payment gates: confirmed
- finding: Clawback/refund path: unknown
- finding: Cost/benefit clarity: unknown
- finding: Recurring funding dependency: unknown
- finding: Six-month treasury flow regime: stressed (basis: total inflow (tau + donations) vs enacted withdrawals)
- finding: Financial confidence: 0.55
- missing: sustainability path
- missing: cost-benefit clarity
- conclusion: Treasury votes require a higher bar because they consume shared ADA and create precedent.

### Risk review
- status: `complete`
- finding: Execution risk: unknown
- finding: Governance risk: unknown
- finding: Technical risk: unknown
- finding: Treasury exposure risk: unknown
- finding: Mitigation evidence: confirmed
- finding: Independent assurance: not confirmed
- finding: Rollback/remedy path: unknown
- finding: Flag count: 1
- missing: independent assurance
- missing: rollback/remedy path
- missing: dependency map
- conclusion: Risk is not a side note; unmitigated execution or governance risk can dominate an otherwise attractive proposal.

### Counterargument pass
- status: `complete`
- finding: Strongest YES: the proposal substantiates "Intersect requests 1,193,000 ADA, stated as $298,250, to support Technical Steering Committee activities for 12 months." and clears the evidence gates.
- finding: Strongest NO: a material claim is unsupported — "The proposal says all expenditure will be fully accounted for and unspent funds will be returned to the Cardano treasury." — so cost or precedent may outweigh the benefit.
- finding: Strongest hold: if claims cannot be tied to replayable evidence, abstaining avoids overclaiming certainty.
- conclusion: A defensible rationale must show the best opposing case before it reaches a vote.

### Synthesis
- status: `ready`
- finding: Final vote must be derived from completed sections above, not from a prose summary.
- finding: The public rationale should name the decisive section and the strongest counterargument.
- conclusion: The vote is only credible if the assessment tree shows enough work for a skeptical delegator to audit.
